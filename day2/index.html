        Task 1: <br>
        1. var and const both initializes variables. <br>
        var has function scope and variables initialized with it can be reassigned. <br>
        const has block scope and variables initialized with it cannot be reassigned. <br>
        2. var has function scope, const has block scope. <br>
        3. let can be reassigned, const cannot. <br>
        4. var: use in cases where you need function-wide variables <br>
        let: use in most "normal" cases <br>
        const: use when a constant is needed <br>
    </p>

        Task 2: <br>
        1. a Boolean is a type with only 2 possible states: True and False. <br>
        2. In JS, most types can be coerced into Boolean, for example, by checking it. <br>
